Many of us would get surprises if we see indian pitta by mistake in our neighborhood during this migration. The reason for the dead pitta might lie in the fact that sometimes birds tend to fight with their own reflection when the come across glazed mirrors. In my case, the building outside which it was found was the same. So birds would hit the reflection on the glass and injured themselves... Unfortunately leaving them helpless",,12

Watching the tireless parents working all day was very entertaining. The nest was occupied by demanding chicks which kept calling all through the day to draw the attention of their parents. To my surprise, yesterday i couldn't see any activity of the parents. As I was moving through the corridors of my office I saw this poor bird lying motionless. I couldn't ascertain the exact cause of this tragedy, I guess it cud have smashed on to the glass panes on seeing its image. I approached it cautiously and saw it's eyes were closed, luckily it was breathing. I put some water near it, but it still didn't respond, I took the bird in my hand and felt it's feeble shaking. I poured water in the other hand, and when the bird opened it's mouth i brought my hand having water closer to its mouth and later left it on the ground which had thick growth of grass. It was late in the evening nearly 2hrs later, i approached it, it's eyes were still closed & was breathing. i gently touched it, it flew past me and perched on a nearby bush.

I ran inside to get my camera and took it’s pic to put here in case I needed some guidance. I sat beside it to check and saw it’s heart thumping. I was a little relieved to see it alive. After sometime it opened it’s eyes and looked at me. It got up and flew towards the parking area in my compound. There it sat in a corner. I thought it was scared of me but later saw 6 birds angrily making noise. 2 drongos, 2 bulbuls and 2 jungle babblers were sitting just near by. Then the drongo suddenly flew towards the kite to attack it even when I was still standing near it. The kite after a while flew away still followed by the agitated birds who were still attacking it.",https://www.facebook.com/groups/indianbirds/permalink/10155671784637411,51
