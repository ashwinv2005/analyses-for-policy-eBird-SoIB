species,Asian Emerald Dove,,,,NA,NA,2/12/2019,Anwesha Ghosh,O12,NA,Today morning I saw this Emerald Dove fly straight into a glass window of a school building and collapse into the ground. It succumbed to the injuries sustained as a result of banging into the glass pane and died within a few minutes. Everything happened so suddenly. It was painful to see a bird die like this..Sadly so many birds die each year as a result of striking into glass panes.. After the collision it flew bizarrely for a few seconds and then collapsed to the ground. It tried digging its head in the undergrowth for a little while and then lay still with its head buried in the undergrowth. I didn't try to revive it as I didn't know how to. Moreover I was too shocked as the whole incident happened very suddenly.,2019,2,12,Facebook,O12

Later understood that Pitta's which are known to migrate to North India for breeding during rainy season, return back around November.

The reason for the dead pitta might lie in the fact that sometimes birds tend to fight with their own reflection when the come across glazed mirrors.

This pair made a nest on the top of a leaf of palm tree, which was well exposed to heavy rains of Bengaluru. Each day they would carry dried leaves to make the nest. Watching the tireless parents working all day was very entertaining. The nest was occupied by demanding chicks which kept calling all through the day to draw the attention of their parents. To my surprise, yesterday i couldn't see any activity of the parents. As I was moving through the corridors of my office I saw this poor bird lying motionless. I couldn't ascertain the exact cause of this tragedy, I guess it cud have smashed on to the glass panes on seeing its image. I approached it cautiously and saw it's eyes were closed, luckily it was breathing. I put some water near it, but it still didn't respond, I took the bird in my hand and felt it's feeble shaking. I poured water in the other hand, and when the bird opened it's mouth i brought my hand having water closer to its mouth and later left it on the ground which had thick growth of grass. It was late in the evening nearly 2hrs later, i approached it, it's eyes were still closed & was breathing. i gently touched it, it flew past me and perched on a nearby bush. I was glad it cud regain the strength to fly again, but i was still worried whether it would be able to fly to the nest again and feed the chicks.

I was a little relieved to see it alive. After sometime it opened it’s eyes and looked at me. It got up and flew towards the parking area in my compound. There it sat in a corner. I thought it was scared of me but later saw 6 birds angrily making noise. 2 drongos, 2 bulbuls and 2 jungle babblers were sitting just near by. Then the drongo suddenly flew towards the kite to attack it even when I was still standing near it. The kite after a while flew away still followed by the agitated birds who were still attacking it.",2018,7,8,Facebook,O45
species,Shikra,Uttar Pradesh,Lucknow,Lucknow,26.848048,80.936332,1/1/1990,Manan Singh Mahadev,O5,NA,Had a really surprising encounter with a Shikra today!! I was inside the college library with my friends for an official photoshoot in the afternoon and suddenly saw this bird of prey fly out of nowhere in front of me! It tried flying out of the library but ended up colliding with one of the glass panels. The bird fell to the ground with a loud thud. I along with a few friends rushed to see the fallen raptor and was relieved to find that it had not suffered any head trauma and neither had broken any of its wings. It was one hell of a collision!!! I was told after a while that the Shikra had flown away. Here is a pic of the Shikra before we left it on the terrace.,1990,1,1,Facebook,O5
