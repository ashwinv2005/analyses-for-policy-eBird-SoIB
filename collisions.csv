Many of us would get surprises if we see indian pitta by mistake in our neighborhood during this migration. The reason for the dead pitta might lie in the fact that sometimes birds tend to fight with their own reflection when the come across glazed mirrors. In my case, the building outside which it was found was the same. So birds would hit the reflection on the glass and injured themselves... Unfortunately leaving them helpless",1990,1,1,"Facebook","O9"

This pair made a nest on the top of a leaf of palm tree, which was well exposed to heavy rains of Bangalore. Each day they would carry dried leaves to make the nest. Watching the tireless parents working all day was very entertaining. The nest was occupied by demanding chicks which kept calling all through the day to draw the attention of their parents. To my surprise, yesterday i couldn't see any activity of the parents. As I was moving through the corridors of my office I saw this poor bird lying motionless. I couldn't ascertain the exact cause of this tragedy, I guess it cud have smashed on to the glass panes on seeing its image. I approached it cautiously and saw it's eyes were closed, luckily it was breathing. I put some water near it, but it still didn't respond, I took the bird in my hand and felt it's feeble shaking. I poured water in the other hand, and when the bird opened it's mouth i brought my hand having water closer to its mouth and later left it on the ground which had thick growth of grass. It was late in the evening nearly 2hrs later, i approached it, it's eyes were still closed & was breathing. i gently touched it, it flew past me and perched on a nearby bush. I was glad it cud regain the strength to fly again, but i was still worried whether it would be able to fly to the nest again and feed the chicks. And the following day i cud see both the parent flying again feeding the young ones in the nest.",2012,9,20,"Facebook","O14"
